## The Software
The libraries used for Nutri Dispenser are linked (`git submodule add`) and credits the original authors. We used these libraries for driving our stepper motor and also for ease of programming our LCD Screen. 


### Programming our Stepper Motor 
With the Stepper Motor Driver library we can easily configure our rotation for our Medication rotating disk with just 1 line of code.
```Python
mymotortest.motor_run(GPins,.01,128, False, False,"full", .05)
```

We then build this into multiple functions we can use to choose which pill to be selected.
```Python
def pillTwo(): 
    GPins = [17, 18, 27, 22] 
    mymotortest.motor_run(GPins,.01,128, True, False,"full", .05)
    time.sleep(2)
def pillTwoReturn():
	GPins = [17, 18, 27, 22]
	mymotortest.motor_run(GPins,.01,128, False, False,"full", .05)
    
    
def pillThree(): 
    GPins = [17, 18, 27, 22] 
    mymotortest.motor_run(GPins,.01,256, True, False,"full", .05)
    time.sleep(2)
def pillThreeReturn():
	GPins = [17, 18, 27, 22]
	mymotortest.motor_run(GPins,.01,256, False, False,"full", .05)
    

def pillFour(): 
    GPins = [17, 18, 27, 22] 
    mymotortest.motor_run(GPins,.01,128, False, False,"full", .05)
    time.sleep(2)
def pillFourReturn():
	GPins = [17, 18, 27, 22]
	mymotortest.motor_run(GPins,.01,128, True, False,"full", .05)
```
We did not need a function for `pillOne` as the default position of the Acuator will always be at pillOne and ready to be dispensed.

### Programming our LCD Display
With our LCD Display library it is also seamless to program the LCD Display. With just 1 line of Code we are able to output what we want.
```Python
display.lcd_display_string("Next Dispense", 1)
display.lcd_display_string("12:00 pm", 2)  
```
